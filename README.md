# Bills-analysis-system
# Project Overview
bBills platform is system that analyzes bills such as (electricity, gas, water, phone) for citizens in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

This project aims to analyze household bills for users and give them alerts in the event that a bill is received at a high or low rate, as it helps them manage their financial affairs better by using the analysis and study of their bills data.

We use these programs to achieve our platform: 
## - For website: 
HTML, CSS, PHP (Visual studio code) 
MySQL (Xampp server) 
- For analysis system: 
Python and Machine learning

# Dataset Structure
Due to the lack of a data set regarding invoices in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we had to create the data set artificially. 
We have four types of target bills, electricity, phone(communication), water, and gas, with total samples 2400 for each dataset.
